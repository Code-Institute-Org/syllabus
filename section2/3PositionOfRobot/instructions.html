<h2>Instructions</h2>

The Thymio robot has a lot of distance sensors: 5 in the front, 2 in the back and two below, towards the ground. But for this exercise, we will use only the front sensors.

If your robot touches obstacles:
 - decrease speed
 - adjust the calibration constant
 - calibrate how much your robot must turn depending on the values of the sensors

What happen if the central distance sensor detects something?

If the robot get blocked:
 - Try to detect it: this Thymio has an embedded GPS. If the value of the GPS does not change => the robot is blocked
 - Try to understand why it is blocked: look in the robot window to see the values of the distance sensors
 - Try to fix it:
  - Go back and turn in a random direction.
  - Turn on the point when all sensors detects something
