<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to develop a startup procedure for the UR5e robot.</p>
<p>You will learn what is a timestep, how to initialize sensors and how to activate a motor in Webots.</p>
<p>You have already seen this simulation in section1/subsection4/object grasping. This time however, you will have to initialize the robot and put it in the good starting position for him to be able to complete its task.</p>
<h3>What is already done?</h3>
<p>The code to detect, grab and place the cans in the box is already done.</p>
<h3>What is left to do?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First, you will need to start and initialize the sensors and motors.</li>
  <li>Then, you will actuate one of the motor to put the arm in position.</li>
<ul>
<h3>How to proceed?</h3>
<p> You will find hereafter a step-by-step procedure to complete those tasks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, have a look at the simulation without changing the code, to see how the robot is acting for now.</li>
  <li>Then, go in the code editor(IDE)->File->Open... and open the robot_controller.py file.</li>
  <li>Look at the python file, it is divided in three:
    <ul>
      <li>A first part of code that contains some imports, constants initialization and some Webots specific code</li>
      <li>Then, an empty space where you will write your code</li>
      <li>Finally the code to detect if a can is approaching the gripper, grasp it and moving it to the box.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now let's get your hands on! When you looked at the simulation you should have realized that the manipulator is not in the right position to grab can.
      To fix this, we need to activate the rotational motor that controls the shoulder joint of the robot. To do so you must follow these steps:
      <ul></ul>
