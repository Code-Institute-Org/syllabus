<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to develop a startup procedure for the UR5e robot.</p>
<p>You will learn what is a timestep, how to initialize sensors and motors in Webots and how to activate a motor.</p>
<p>You have already seen this simulation in section1/subsection4/object grasping. This time however, you will have to initialize the robot and put it in the good starting position for him to be able to complete its task.</p>
<h3>What is already done:</h3>
<p>The code to detect, grab and place the cans in the box is already done.</p>
<h3>What is left to do:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First, you will need to start and initialize the sensors and motors.</li>
  <li>Then, you will actuate one of the motor to put the arm in position.</li>
<ul>
