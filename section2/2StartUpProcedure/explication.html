<p>From now on, you will program the robot in python.</p>
<p>Before putting your hands on the code, let's see the functionnalities of the development environment that you will use.</p>
<p>The environment consists of five windows, that you can open and close at your will with the buttons on left toolbar.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The "Simulation" shows the view of Webots. It can be open/close with the button representing a 3D cube.
  <li>The "Information" window regroup all you need to know about the exercise: the theory and the different tasks you will be requested to complete. Its button is the "I"</li>
  <li>The "IDE" is where you will write your code. Its button is the "< >"</li>
  <li>The "Terminal", will display the outputs and errors of the simulation. It is represented by this sign: ">_". If you want to clean the terminal, click on it and press "CTRL + L".</li>
  <li>Finally, the "Robot window" will show the value of the motors and sensors of the robot. It opens via the dial-shaped button</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the IDE, terminal and robot window will only be active once the simulation is loaded as depend on it.</p>
<p>Also note that if you close or reload the page, all the modifications you made to the code will be lost.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate to play with the layout by closing, moving, resizing windows, such that you feel good to work with it!</p>

<p>Finally, we strongly advise you to put the whole development environment in full screen. To do so, click on the "Full screen" button on the bottom left corner of the environment.</p>
