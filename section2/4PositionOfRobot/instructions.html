<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Situation and Goal</h3>
<p>In the first part of this exercise, you will learn to control a Thymio robot in position, speed and force.</p>
<p>Then, you will take into account the values returned by the distance sensors of the Thymio to make your robot avoid the obstacle automatically</p>

<h3>What is already done?</h3>
<p>All the initializations is already done: the front distance sensors are enable and we retrieved the motors for you and put them in variables.

<h3>What is left to do?</h3>
<p>This time, you will program the whole behaviour of the robot. To begin, you will activate the engine and then link their speed with the value of the distance sensors.</p>

<h3>Hands-on</h3>

<h4>1 Control one motor in position</h4>

<p><u>Explanation</u></p>

<p>First, you wil control the motor of a wheel in position, exactly as you did in the previous exercises. And to really begin with the simplest thing, you will activate only motor, the <code>leftMotor</code></p>

<p><u>Task</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a look at the simulation, in the simulation window. If you closed it, you can reopen it by clicking the 3D cube icon.</li>
  <li>Open the controller by going in the code editor(IDE)->File->Open... and open the robot_controller.py file.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Expected result</u></p>

The Thymio robot has a lot of distance sensors: 5 in the front, 2 in the back and two below, towards the ground. But for this exercise, we will use only the front sensors.

If your robot touches obstacles:
 - decrease speed
 - adjust the calibration constant
 - calibrate how much your robot must turn depending on the values of the sensors

What happen if the central distance sensor detects something?

If the robot get blocked:
 - Try to detect it: this Thymio has an embedded GPS. If the value of the GPS does not change => the robot is blocked
 - Try to understand why it is blocked: look in the robot window to see the values of the distance sensors
 - Try to fix it:
  - Go back and turn in a random direction.
  - Turn on the point when all sensors detects something
